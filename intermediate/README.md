## Intermediate source files ## 

This repo contains the intermediate steps of this Quine relay.  I haven't gotten the full thing to work, but the ones that did generate, I've placed here.  The file `generate_quine_relay.sh` shows the exact lines used (some of which deviate from those in Mame's original readme) to generate them, with the unsuccessful part commented out.
